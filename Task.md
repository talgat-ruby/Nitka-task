# Task

Develop a web-application for hotel booking using React and Redux.

1. Keep the hotels data in json (on the client side, no server needed).

2. Choose 20 hotels on booking.com. The information on each hotel should include:

   hotel’s name
   number of stars
   a photo (or a few)
   description
   city

3. The application should include two pages:

   home page with search
   hotel details and booking

4. On the homepage:

   text box for search using a hotel name or a city (in one text box)
   Search results (picture, name, stars, city).

   If the user has not entered anything,
   the best offers are shown by default (5 random hotels)

5. On the hotel page:

   all information about the hotel
   booking form: check-in/check-out dates and a “book” button. All hotels are supposed to be available for booking.
   if the user presses the "Book" button, a message about the successful booking is displayed

6. Please, submit the results in the following way:

   the code on github
   the running application on a free hosting.

_It is not allowed to send archives with the code._
